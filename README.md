# Sims 1 Legacy Collection – Modding Guide

A community-maintained guide for modding, customising and creating content for **The Sims Legacy Collection** – the 2025 25th anniversary re-release of The Sims 1 on Steam, EA App and Epic Games Store.

🌐 **Live site: [cyndersanity.github.io/sims-legacy-mod-guide](https://cyndersanity.github.io/sims-legacy-mod-guide/)**

## About the guide

This guide was built because the Legacy Collection has a slightly different folder structure, save location and tool compatibility compared to the original Complete Collection or disc versions – and most existing guides were written for one of those. This guide is specifically for Legacy Collection players on Windows, covering everything from installing your first mod through to creating custom content from scratch.

All content is based on community testing, verified tool compatibility checks, and direct research into what works (and doesn't) with the Legacy Collection as of 2026.

## Site structure

Static HTML only – no framework, no build step, no dependencies. Deployed directly via GitHub Pages from the root of the repository. Shared CSS lives in `style.css`; pages with unique components (index, cheats, careers, terminology, updates) keep only their page-specific rules inline. All JavaScript is inline and vanilla. CC creation subpages include prev/next navigation links for sequential reading.

```

## Navigation structure

The site uses a horizontal scrolling nav bar on desktop and a slide-in drawer on mobile (opened via the "Menu ☰" button). The desktop nav also has a ☰ button in the bar for users who prefer the drawer.

Nav is organised into dropdowns:

- **Site Info** – About Legacy, Terminology, Site Roadmap, Contact
- **Mods / CC** – What's Possible, Installing Mods, Mod Download Sites, Must-Have Mods
- **Gameplay** – Cheats, Career Guide
- **Create CC** – Overview, Making Clothing, Making Hair & Heads, Making Walls & Floors, Object Retextures, IFF Hacking, Tools
- **Troubleshooting** – CC Issues, Game Issues

---

## Design system

The site uses a consistent set of CSS custom properties defined in `style.css`:

| Variable | Value | Used for |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `--cream` | `#F5F2E8` | Page background |
| `--green` | `#3BAE5C` | Primary brand colour, buttons, links |
| `--green-dark` | `#1A5229` | Headings, nav, footer |
| `--green-pale` | `#E6F5EB` | Card backgrounds, hover states |
| `--gold` | `#E8B84B` | Warning callouts |
| `--teal` | `#3AADA8` | Info callouts |
| `--red` | `#D94F4F` | Error callouts |
| `--ink` | `#1C2B1F` | Body text |

**Fonts:** Paytone One (headings), Nunito (body), IBM Plex Mono (code) – all loaded from Google Fonts.

**Callout convention:**
```html
<div class="callout teal">ℹ️ Info note</div>
<div class="callout gold">⚠️ Warning</div>
<div class="callout red">🚨 Critical warning</div>
<div class="callout green">✅ Tip or confirmation</div>
```

**Step-by-step lists:**
```html
<div class="steps">
  <div class="step">
    <div class="step-num"></div>
    <div class="step-body"><h4>Step title</h4><p>Step content.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Tables** must always be wrapped in `.table-wrap`:
```html
<div class="table-wrap">
  <table>...</table>
</div>
```

## Adding or editing pages

### Editing existing content

Each page is self-contained HTML. Open the file in any text editor and edit the content inside `<main class="content">`. Shared CSS is in `style.css`; page-specific styles (if any) are in an inline `<style>` block. Nav is inline per page.

### Adding a new page

1. Copy an existing page (e.g. `about-legacy.html`) as a starting point
2. Update the `<title>` tag, `<h1>`, `.page-eyebrow`, and `.page-sub` to match the new page
3. Replace the content inside `<main class="content">` with your new content
4. Update the nav across all pages – add the new link to every page's nav-inner and drawer blocks
5. Add the page to `sitemap.xml`
6. Update the search index in `search.html` (the `INDEX` const at the top of the inline `<script>`)

### Updating the nav

The nav uses JS-driven dropdown panels built inline in each HTML file. To update nav links or add a page, edit the nav block in every HTML file manually, or use find-and-replace in VS Code across the project.

`nav_builder.py` handles the **footer only** – run it to sync footer links and the "Last updated" date across all pages:

```bash
python nav_builder.py --all
```
